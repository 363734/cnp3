Like any open-source project, the future of Computer Networking Principles, Protocols and Practice will depend on the work of contributors. Most of the text has been written by Olivier Bonaventure. Laurent Vanbever, Virginie Van den Schriek, Damien Saucez and Mickael Hoerdt have contributed to exercises. 
 
 The development of the textbook is managed through a trac platform at https://scm.info.ucl.ac.be/trac/cnp3 . You can contribute to the project by : 

  - sending comments, suggestions or bug reports  by filing tickets  on https://scm.info.ucl.ac.be/trac/cnp3/newticket or via the CNP3 mailing list at https://listes-2.sipr.ucl.ac.be/sympa/subscribe/cnp3
  - proposing new exercises on the mailing list
  - proposing new sections or chapters on the CNP3 mailing list 
  - follow the development on the book's 'facebook page <http://www.facebook.com/pages/Computer-Networking-Principles-Protocols-and-Practice/129951043755620>'
  
 A stable release of the textbook will be issued at least once per year on http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/CNP3 and the development version will always be available from https://scm.info.ucl.ac.be/trac/cnp3 . 

You can download the sources via subversion by using
 
    svn co https://scm.info.ucl.ac.be/svn/cnp3/book 

The book was compiled on MacOS/X Snow Leopard using sphinx. inkscape is required to convert some of the images in png format. Most of the images will be converted to the SVG format to improve the portability of the textbook. python is also required

The textbook was written on a Mac running Snow Leopard, but it should rebuild on other Unix based systems. Comments on issues in rebuilding the textbook are welcome.
