The datalink layer and the Local Area Networks
==============================================


The datalink layer is the lowest layer of the reference model that we discuss in details. As mentioned previously, there are two type of datalink layers. The first datalink layers that appeared are the ones that are used on point-to-point links between endsystems that are directly connected by a physical link. We will briefly discuss one of these datalink layers in this chapter. The second type of datalink layers are the ones used in Local Area Networks. The main difference between the point-to-point and the LAN datalink layers is that the latter need to regulate the access to the Local Area Network which is usually a shared medium. 
This chapter is organised as follows. We first discuss the principles and of datalink layer and the service that it uses from the physical layer. Then we describe in more details several Medium Access Control algorithms that are used by Local Area Networks to regulate the access to the shared medium. Finally we discuss in details several important datalink layer technologies with an emphasis on Ethernet.

Summary
#######

In this chapter, we have first explained the principles of the datalink layer. We have considered two types of datalink layers : those used over point-to-point links and those used over Local Area Networks.
