2. Consider the switched network shown in the figure above.  In this network, assume that the LAN between switches `3` and `12` fails. How should the switches update their port/address tables after the link failure ?

3. Many enterprise networks are organized with a set of backbone devices interconnected by using a full mesh of links as shown in the figure below. In this network, what are the benefits and drawbacks of using Ethernet switches and IP routers running OSPF ?
