.. [#fclass] In addition to the A, B and C classes, :rfc:`791` also defined the `D` and `E` classes of IPv4 addresses. Class `D` (resp. `E`) addresses are those whose high order bits are set to `1110` (resp. `1111`). Class `D` addresses are used by IP multicast and will be explained later. Class `E` addresses are currently unused, but there are some discussions on possible future usages [WMH2008]_ [FLM2008]_
