Writing simple networked applications
#####################################


This section still needs to be written. Networked applications are usually implemented by using the socket API. This API is supported by most programming langages and several textbooks have been devoted to this socket API. Users of the C langage can consult [DC2009]_ or [Stevens1998]_. The Java implementation of the sockets API is described in [CD2008]_ and in the `Java tutorial <http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/sockets/index.html>`_. Users of `python <http://www.python.org>`_ may consult the `socket section <http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html>`_ of the `python documentation <http://docs.python.org/>`_ .
