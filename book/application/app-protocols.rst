Application-level protocols
###########################


Many protocols have been defined for networked applications. In this section, we describe some of the important applications that are used on the Internet. We first explain the Domain Name System (DNS) that enables hosts to be identified by human-friendly names instead of the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that are used by the network. Then, we describe the operation of electronic mail, one of the first killer applications on the global Internet, and the protocols used on world wide web.
