The book was compiled on MacOS/X Snow Leopard using sphinx. inkscape is required to convert some of the images in png format. Most of the images will be converted to the SVG format to improve the portability of the textbook. python is also required. When US and British spelling disagree, we opt for US spelling.

The textbook was written on a Mac running Snow Leopard, but it should rebuild on other Unix based systems. Comments on issues in rebuilding the textbook are welcome.
